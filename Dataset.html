        <h3>This Dataset was extracted from ABC news. It includes the date of publication and headlines from 2003-2020</h3>
        <h3>With this dataset I would make a timeline over the past decade that shows how the media (ABC) reports stories over time.</h3>
        <h3> It would be a good idea to find if other media outlets have headlines data availbale too, to compare how different publications report certain topics.</h3>
        <h3>Overall, the visualizations would highligth trends in stories along with a timeline to give context of these events. (i.e, presidential elections, global emergencies, olympics coverage, etc.)</h3>
