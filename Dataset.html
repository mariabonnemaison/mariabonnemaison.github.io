        <h1>A million Headlines Dataset</h1>

        <p>This Dataset was extracted from ABC news. It includes the date of publication and headlines from 2003-2020</p>
        <p>With this dataset I would make a timeline over the past decade that shows how the media (ABC) reports stories over time.</p>
        <p>It would be a good idea to find if other media outlets have headlines data availbale too, to compare how different
        <p>publications report certain topics. Overall, the visualizations would highligth trends in stories along with a timeline</p>
        <p>to give context of these events.(i.e, presidential elections, global emergencies, olympics coverage, etc.)</p>

            <p>Update: I found APIs from The New York Times and AP News. From what I understand, NYT will give me full access to search articles, but AP News has various pricing plans that restrict access.</p>
